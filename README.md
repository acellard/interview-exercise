# Go API

This application is a simple REST API which provides one serviceto run a provided dockerfile.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you'll need a Docker and/or Golang working environment.<br>
Install Docker compose : https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/<br>

### Installing

Step-by-step installation guide
Clone repo following go convention:
```
 cd ~/go/src/github.com/alisstaki
 git clone https://github.com/alisstaki/interview-exercise.git
 cd interview-exercise
```
Start app
```
make start
```

The app should be up and running and see something like that in your terminal:
```
API ready to receive content...
```

## Dependencies

* Third parties libraries used : https://github.com/gorilla/mux to manage services routing and https://github.com/moby/buildkit to validate dockerfile

## Running the tests

For time optimization, I've decided to not unittest this api

## Consuming the API

You can upload your dockerfile using a POST to http://localhost:8080/run :
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/run \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---011000010111000001101001' \
  --form 'file=FROM ubuntu:16.04

# train machine learning model
```bash
cat <<EOF > Dockerfile.test
FROM ubuntu:16.04
ARG version
ENV VERSION=${version}
CMD echo '{"perf":0.99}' > "/data/perf-${VERSION}.json"
EOF

# save performances

CMD echo '\''{"perf":0.99}'\'' > /data/perf.json'
```

You can check job status and model performance using a GET to http://localhost:8080/status:
```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:8080/status?id=62a86742-3faa-4212-a2f3-8f6ab0b6950a'
```

## To go further

With given limited time, the focus was made to have a running project and a validity check on the dockerfile.
To continue, I would focus on security and only allow a certain set of command in the provided dockerfile, and run it in a more secure environment.
Also jwt token authentication would be added to allow only known client to upload a dockerfile.
To manage the job I would use a Redis instead of in-memory map.

At last, additionnal time could be spent to have a cleaner code and to have a better error management.
